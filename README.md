# 09-Juicy-Breakout

For this project we were assigned to take our previous paddle game and make it 'juicy'. This means that by using our creativity, to increase the game feel and make it more fun to play.

The player bounces the ball off of the paddle to collect the tiles and get a high score, and if the ball falls below the paddle the player loses a life. To spawn a new ball, the player clicks on the mouse. Should the lives reach 0, a the tiles, paddle, and ball disappear, and the words 'Game Over! Thanks for playing!' in big letters will appear. The game over page will also appear if the player collects all of the tiles before the lives reach 0.
